## Design:

### Design Choices
<p> The Harry Potter multiverse (both books and mives) itself is a multiverse with a wide target audience, and with this in mind I wanted to create a site that was accessible to everyone regardless of their technical ability, level of english, and ability to operate a computer. I wanted all designs to be simplistic, the navigation to be logical and seamless and for the accessibility to be a primary concern. </p>

### Colour

  <p>The color scheme that I have used throughout the website is taken directly from the brand guidelines that were available online. I used the following site to get the color scheme: https://www.qualitylogoproducts.com/blog/harry-potter-color-schemes/ . The colors here are used throughout the site on eachpage and interaction. </p>

<details><summary>Colours: Gryffindor</summary>
  <img src="docs/colour-scheme/gryffindor.png"></details>

  <details><summary>Colours: Slytherin</summary>
  <img src="docs/colour-scheme/slytherin.png"></details>

   <details><summary>Colours: Ravenclaw</summary>
  <img src="docs/colour-scheme/ravenclaw.png"></details>

  <details><summary>Colours: Hufflepuff</summary>
  <img src="docs/colour-scheme/hufflepuff.png"></details>

 ### Fonts
  <p>Fonts used on the website were Arial and Benne - A sans serif with a Harry Potter vibe. Benne was used for headings and arial was used in pteh answers.</p>

 ### Structure
<p>The structure of this website was designed to be easily navagated through and easy to learn. I made sure that each page followed a similar structure but didn't comprimise the content that each page held. The following sections are within the structure of the site:</p>

<ul>
<li> A home Page = Start button for the quiz and a contact button for users to access a contact form.</li>
<li> A Contact page = The contact page allows users to send an email to the site owner to give feedback on the site. </li>
<li> The quiz Section = The quiz section is where the questions and answers are. The user has 4 answer options to choose from and depending on the answer (if correct or incorrect) the user an icon with the correct answer will show. If your answer is wrong an x will appear beside it. Also here, the user is able to dictate what question their on by the question counter at the bottom of the section. There is a timer at the top of the section that will count down from 20 seconds, and if it runs out it will disable the quiz and show the correct answer.</li>
<li> The Results Page = Shows the user their score out of ten. It will also give the user the option of restarting the quiz or quiting it - taking them back to the start/home page.</li>
<li> Also in the quiz there is an info section that goes over some rules that the user has to follow when going through the quiz.</li>

<hr>

<p>The wireframes included have evolved and changed since I originally drew them up over a week ago. This is due to the limitations of my skills thus far, and developed and changes I have made personally to the look of the site when building it.</p>

<li> Code to help with the contact form was taken from bootstrap: https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.1/forms/form-control/ 
</li>
<li> I also used a youtube video to help further my understanding of JavaScript and aid me in the making of my quiz: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUBhpSRS_fk&t=1732s . It was not copied and pasted directly but it was used for help so I thought I would mention it. </li>
