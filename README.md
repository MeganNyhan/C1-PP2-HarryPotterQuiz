## Design:

### Design Choices
<p> The Harry Potter multiverse (both books and mives) itself is a multiverse with a wide target audience, and with this in mind I wanted to create a site that was accessible to everyone regardless of their technical ability, level of english, and ability to operate a computer. I wanted all designs to be simplistic, the navigation to be logical and seamless and for the accessibility to be a primary concern. </p>

### Colour

  <p>The color scheme that I have used throughout the website is taken directly from the brand guidelines that were available online. I used the following site to get the color scheme: https://www.qualitylogoproducts.com/blog/harry-potter-color-schemes/ . The colors here are used throughout the site on eachpage and interaction. </p>

<details><summary>Colours: Gryffindor</summary>
  <img src="assets/images/gryffindor.png"></details>

  <details><summary>Colours: Slytherin</summary>
  <img src="assets/images/slytherin.png"></details>

   <details><summary>Colours: Ravenclaw</summary>
  <img src="assets/images/ravenclaw.png"></details>

  <details><summary>Colours: Hufflepuff</summary>
  <img src="assets/images/hufflepuff.png"></details>

 ### Fonts
  <p>Fonts used on the website were Arial and Benne - A sans serif with a Harry Potter vibe. Benne was used for headings and arial was used in pteh answers.</p>

 ### Structure
<p>The strucutre of this website was designed to be easily navagated through and easy to learn. I made sure that each page followed a similar structure but didn't comprimise the content that each page held. The following pages are within the structure of the site:</p>

<ul>
<li> A home Page = Basic information about the site, with an image of the building and a meet the team section.</li>
<li> A Services page = The services page offers an overview of the services offered by the resource center. </li>
<li> A gallery page = Offers the user a chance to see possible familiar faces taking part in local activites/ meetings.    This page aims to encourage the user to want to partake in the activites/ events themselves.</li>
<li> A Contact Page = Gives the user contact information and a google maps view of where the building is. There is also a contact form for a user to use to contact the comapny.</li>

<hr>

### Wireframes

<p>The wireframes included have evolved and changed since I originally drew them up over a week ago. This is due to the limitations of my skills thus far, and developed and changes I have made personally to the look of the site when building it.</p>

### Source Code Used in Site

<p> Due to limitations in my knowledge I googled certain code that I wanted to use for the site, see code listed below:</p>
<ul>
<li> Code to help with the contact form was taken from bootstrap: https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.1/forms/form-control/ 
</li>
<li> I also used a youtube video to help further my understanding of JavaScript and aid me in the making of my quiz: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUBhpSRS_fk&t=1732s . It was not copied and pasted directly but it was used for help so I thought I would mention it. </li>
</ul>
